# Cricket_VisualizationCritique
Hello to all the Cricket enthusiasts. 
This crtique review is about a Wagon wheel presentation of one innings of Virat Kohli where he scored 77* and covered most part of the ground(as always).
The review contains information about the pros, cons, and what changes can be made in the visualization in order to make it more engaging for the viewers.
I have attached a google drive link to the video of my review in the PPT.
Do give it a watch and reach out to me on LinkedIn for any suggestions or advice. (Always up for a cricket discussion)
